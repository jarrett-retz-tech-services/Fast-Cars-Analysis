    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "I live on a busy street. Many people who drive by are in a hurry, and speeding has been a chronic problem. However, it's been difficult to describe how bad the speeding is. Our only evidence has come from accident reports on our street. Therefore, I'd like to use some statistics to see if I can prove that people routinely speed down our residential street.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I'll set up an experiment to sample the speeds of cars driving past our house and do some hypothesis tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll test whether the average speed of a car driving by our house is greater than 35 mph (the speed limit is 30 mph).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "- The population parameter we want to estimate is from an infinite population, so we won't have to make any corrections for finite populations.\n",
    "- The speed of cars is a continuous random variable\n",
    "- The population distribution is unknown\n",
    "- The population standard deviation is unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first thought of the experiment, I wanted to use the margin of error calculation to determine the sample size necessary for my desired margin of error for a confidence interval. However, not knowing whether the population was normally distributed and not knowing the population standard deviation meant I would have to use the t-distribution for this calculation. Unfortunately, I would need a sample size to determine the degrees of freedom (DOF) to get the t-statistic necessary, which I didn't have. Additionally, I didn't have the standard deviation but I could have done a pilot sample to remedy that limitation. Consequently, I was unable to perform this part of the experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, if we were to *assume*: \n",
    "- The population is normally distributed\n",
    "- The population standard deviation is 5.07 (from our pilot sample)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we could choose a margin of error, say 1.5 mph, and calculate the need for 44 samples to achieve such a margin."

    "\n",
    "There are several options for measuring speed. However, I used a less accurate approach because this experiment was more about understanding statistical concepts. Consequently, to calculate speed I measured the distance of the road outside my house and timed how long it took cars to travel that distance. Then, I converted the measurements and divided the distance traveled by the time (in seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance I used in the experiment was 1,382 in. I came to this number by walking the distance from one lane dividing line (yellow dash in the middle of the roadway) to the start of a different lane dividing line. I took 45 paces between these two-lane dividing lines. Next, I looked up how to estimate the length of a person's stride based on their height. I'm 6'2\" and I read one can estimate their stride length by multiplying their height by 0.415. Subsequently, I took my approximate stride length and multiplied it by how many strides I took. This calculation gave me the distance in inches. Finally, I converted the value to miles."
