# Fast Cars

The repository contains an analysis performed to test a hypothesis on the speed of cars outside my home. The purpose of the experiment was to take something interesting to me and apply statistical concepts to get a better idea on how those statistical concepts work in the real world.

Below is an excerpt from the `.ipynb` analysis:

> I live on a busy street. Many people who drive by are in a hurry, and speeding has been a chronic problem. However, it's been difficult to describe how bad the speeding is. Our only evidence has come from accident reports on our street. Therefore, I'd like to use some statistics to see if I can prove that people routinely speed down our residential street.
>
>To do this, I'll set up an experiment to sample the speeds of cars driving past our house and do some hypothesis tests.
>
>I'll test whether the average speed of a car driving by our house is greater than 35 mph (the speed limit is 30 mph).

### Python Version
